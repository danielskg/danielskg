## Hello everyone! 😀

My name's Daniel and I am new to coding. I live and code in Thessaloniki, Greece 🇬🇷 .

I started with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript some 2 years ago, had a big break for about a year, and started again 2 months ago.

Now I am self-learning PHP, Python, PostgreSQL, Web APIs and Blockchain technology, all at the same time! 

I will be uploading here some small practice pieces of code for self-reference.

That's all for now.

Keep safe!  
Daniel

(p.s. If you stumble upon any mistakes in any of my codes, please tell me so)
